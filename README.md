# Diagnosis of Pulmonary Nodules in Chest CT images using Deep Learning
Diagnosis of Pulmonary Nodules in Chest CT images using Deep Learning
In this project, we utilize a transfer learning (TL) strategy by adopting a pre-trained classification network that is used to differentiate pulmonary nodules from nodule-like tissues. 
The proposed method is a combination of three modules: 
a)	Image preprocessing and segmentation
b)	Nodule Classification using a pre-trained model (Transfer Learning using VGG16)
c)	Semi-Supervised Learning for unlabelled data
